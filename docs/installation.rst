Installation
============

First, make sure that you have a python environment set up for the application with jupyter notebooks installed. For
information on how to do this, please check `NmrQuant's documentation on installation <nmrquant.readthedocs.org>`_.

Once this is done, open up a terminal in the activated environment and type in:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install MSPT

Next download the notebook file containing the gui interface from the
`GitHub page <https://github.com/llegregam/PascalTriangle>`_.

Launch the jupyter notebook application from inside the environment and open the PascalTriangle notebook. You are
now ready to use the software!
