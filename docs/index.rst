Welcome to MSPT's documentation!
================================

Mass Spectrometry Pascal's Triangle (MSPT) is a python software to compute biases between experimental and
theoretical values of isotopologue distributions during production of biological standards using controlled
labeling patterns. For more information on the subject, check
`this publication <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25225869/>`_.

It is one of the routine tools used on the `MetaToul platform <https://www6.toulouse.inrae.fr/metatoul>`_.

The code is open-source, and available on Github under a GPLv3 license.

It can be used from a command line interface or through an interactive jupyter notebook GUI. The notebook can be
